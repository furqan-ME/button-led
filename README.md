# button-led
First Arduino project - controlling an LED with a button.


## 🧠 How I Learned

I used a combination of ChatGPT, YouTube, and online tutorials to understand Arduino basics — especially how digital inputs work and the use of pull-down resistors.

This project is part of my learning journey in electronics and embedded systems. I’ll continue documenting what I build and learn along the way.



# Arduino Button-LED Project
This is my first Arduino mini-project. It turns an LED on when a button is pressed, using a digital input pin.

## 💡 What I Learned
- How to use a push button with Arduino
- Pull-down resistors and digital input logic
- Basic `digitalRead()` and `digitalWrite()`

## 🛠️ Circuit
- 1x LED
- 1x Push button
- 1x 220Ω resistor (for LED)
- 1x 10kΩ resistor (pull-down for button)
